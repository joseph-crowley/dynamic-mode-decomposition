# Advanced Analyses with DMD

Dynamic Mode Decomposition offers a robust framework for analyzing complex systems. For advanced applications in physics, DMD can be extended to explore systems' phase space, energy conservation, and non-linear dynamics.

## Phase-Plane Analysis

DMD's ability to separate dynamic features makes it particularly useful in phase-plane analysis. For systems like the SHO, DMD can reveal the trajectory in phase space, providing insights into the system's stability and energy exchange.

## Hamiltonian Systems and Energy Flow

In Hamiltonian mechanics, energy conservation and symplectic structure are key. DMD can be applied to study how energy flows through different modes in a Hamiltonian system. By analyzing the DMD modes and their corresponding eigenvalues, one can infer the distribution and transfer of energy, especially in quasi-periodic or chaotic systems.

## Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos

DMD's connection with the Koopman operator theory makes it a potent tool for studying nonlinear dynamics and chaos. It can help in identifying regions of stability, bifurcations, and the onset of chaotic behavior in dynamical systems.
